I am Chi Zhang, a junior but passionate researcher working on AI for Science and Computational Imaging! I am currently a first-year Ph.D. Student in the Dept. Health Tech. & Informatics at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), a member of [STEM Laboratory of Genomics and Artificial Intelligence](https://genomicmedicine.github.io/site/#/) supervised by [Prof. Weixiong Zhang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/hti/people/academic-staff/prof-zhang-weixiong/).

I got my M.S. degree (2023) in School of Information and Communication Engineering from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), a member of [MediaLab](https://medialab.uestc.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Prof. Shuai Wang](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wangshuai/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Changhui Rao](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~chrao). Before came to UESTC, I got my B.S. degree in Communication Engineering in 2020. I also have been a research assistant at the School of Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangyang) in 2021-2023.
